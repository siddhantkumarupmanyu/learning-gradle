tbh right now, i don't even know how to proceed...


FROM STICKY NOTE,
// now it's better to not. lol... still idk...
so, what i am thinking right now, is kind of like replicating that thing by myself,
like defining those tasks by myself, and like compiling and building and depends everything...
and then if possible, creating a plugin or something...
that would be so much helpful in understanding gradle build system
